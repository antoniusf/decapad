# Hello and Goodbye

For the longest time, this project’s description read “backup only for now, will say more when this is in an acceptable state”. Turns out, it never got to a state I considered acceptable, and it probably never will. So while “now” technically isn’t the best time to say a bit more about it, it’s unlikely that a better time will come.

This was once supposed to be a decentralized collaborative text editor. At the time I started this project, most collaborative editing solutions used operational transforms, which can be a little icky and are quite hard to do without a central server. Decapad’s protocol was – even though I didn’t know it when I began – based on CRDTs instead. I feel like CRDT-based solutions have gained quite a bit of popularity in the recent years; this, combined with the fact that I have, well, gotten older and more realistic in that period of time, lead me to conclude that this wasn’t actually that useful of a thing to be working on anymore. Hopefully I’ll post a write-up of things I learned at some point in the future :)
